Cursors
-Cursor is an interface and it is used to retrieve or fetch the objects or elements one by one from the Collection objects.
-Cursor has 3 types
	1. Enumaration Interface
	2. Iterator Interface
	3. ListIterator Interface

NOTE: Also, Spliterator is added as a new cursor with Java 8.
-It provides support for parallel processing of stream of elements for any collection. 
-It provides tryAdvance() method to iterate elements individually in different threads. 
-It helps in parallel processing.



Enumeration vs Iterator vs ListIterator in Java
-Enumeration is used in the collection framework in java to retrieve the elements one by one. 
-Enumeration is a legacy interface that is applicable only for legacy classes like Vector, HashTable, Stack, etc. 
-It provides a single direction of iteration. 
-By using enumeration, we can perform only read operation.
-It provides 
	-hasMoreElements() method to check if elements are presented 
	-nextElement() method to retrieve the next element.



-Iterator is a universal cursor that can be applied to any collection object. 
-It provides a single direction iteration. 
-By using an iterator, we can perform both read and remove operation, but we cannot perform replace operation. 
-Iterator must be used whenever we want to enumerate elements in all collection framework implemented interfaces like Set, List, Queue, DeQue.
-It provides 
	-hasNext() method to check if elements are presented
	-next() method to retrieve the next element.
	-remove() method to remove-delete the current element.
